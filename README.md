Creating a complete audio book application is a substantial project, and it's beyond the scope of a single response. However, I can provide you with a basic outline and example code snippets to help you get started with a simple audio book application using React Native and TypeScript.

### Prerequisites:
Make sure you have Node.js, npm, and React Native CLI installed on your machine.

```bash
# Install React Native CLI globally
npm install -g react-native-cli
```

### Step 1: Create a New React Native Project

```bash
npx react-native init AudioBookApp --template react-native-template-typescript
cd AudioBookApp
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install react-native-track-player react-navigation react-navigation-stack
```

### Step 3: Implement Audio Player Component

Create a new file `AudioPlayer.tsx` for the audio player component:

```tsx
// AudioPlayer.tsx
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button } from 'react-native';
import TrackPlayer from 'react-native-track-player';

const AudioPlayer: React.FC = () => {
  const startAudio = async () => {
    await TrackPlayer.setupPlayer();
    await TrackPlayer.add({
      id: 'track1',
      url: 'URL_TO_YOUR_AUDIO_FILE',
      title: 'Audio Title',
      artist: 'Audio Author',
    });
    await TrackPlayer.play();
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Audio Player</Text>
      <Button title="Play Audio" onPress={startAudio} />
    </View>
  );
};

export default AudioPlayer;
```

### Step 4: Integrate Audio Player Component

Replace the content of `App.tsx` with the following:

```tsx
// App.tsx
import React from 'react';
import { NavigationContainer } from '@react-navigation/native';
import { createStackNavigator } from '@react-navigation/stack';
import AudioPlayer from './AudioPlayer';

const Stack = createStackNavigator();

const App: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <NavigationContainer>
      <Stack.Navigator>
        <Stack.Screen name="Home" component={AudioPlayer} />
      </Stack.Navigator>
    </NavigationContainer>
  );
};

export default App;
```

### Step 5: Run the Application

Start the React Native development server:

```bash
npx react-native start
```

Run the application on an emulator or a physical device:

```bash
npx react-native run-android   # for Android
npx react-native run-ios       # for iOS
```

This is a basic example to get you started. Depending on your requirements, you may want to add more features, such as a list of audio books, navigation between screens, play/pause controls, etc.

Remember to replace `'URL_TO_YOUR_AUDIO_FILE'` with the actual URL of your audio file.

This example uses `react-native-track-player` for audio playback, and you might want to explore its documentation for more advanced features: [React Native Track Player](https://react-native-track-player.js.org/).
